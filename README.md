# xlfg

An autonomous proof-first SDLC guide for Claude Code, designed for Opus-class models.

## Status

**v6.2.0** is the conductor+skills architecture: two slash commands acting as conductors, each dispatching a pipeline of hidden phase skills. Phase bodies load just-in-time via the `Skill` tool, not all at once in the command body. No sub-agents, no nested delegation, no v5 coordination files, no Codex surface. The durable archive under `docs/xlfg/` (current-state + per-run summaries/diagnoses) stays.

See `plugins/xlfg-engineering/CHANGELOG.md` for the full evolution from v5 to v6.2.

## What you get

- `/xlfg "<request>"` — dispatches 8 phase skills in order: recall → intent → context → plan → implement → verify → review → compound. Each skill loads when invoked, runs in the main model's context, and returns. Ends by writing `docs/xlfg/runs/<RUN_ID>/run-summary.md` (Ask / What changed / Proof / Residual risk / Durable lesson) and optionally updating `docs/xlfg/current-state.md`.
- `/xlfg-debug "<request>"` — dispatches 4 phase skills: recall → intent → context → debug. Diagnosis-only: `allowed-tools` includes `Write` (for the diagnosis file) but excludes `Edit` and `MultiEdit` (product source stays untouched). Ends by writing `docs/xlfg/runs/<RUN_ID>/diagnosis.md`.

The conductor carries the pipeline order, loopback rules, and operating contract; the phase bodies live in `plugins/xlfg-engineering/skills/xlfg-*-phase/SKILL.md` (9 files total, three shared between the conductors). The tracked `docs/xlfg/` archive is how cross-session memory survives — there is no `.xlfg/` coordination state.

## Install

```text
/plugin marketplace add flrngel/xlfg
/plugin install xlfg-engineering@flrngel
```

Then:

```
/xlfg add a retry policy to the webhook consumer with exponential backoff
/xlfg-debug the auth middleware drops the session cookie on subdomain crossover
```

Update with `/plugin marketplace update xlfg`.

Cursor users: the plugin ships a `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` manifest. Codex support was removed in v6.

## What's in this repo

1. `plugins/xlfg-engineering/` — the plugin itself (commands, hooks, audit script, manifests, CHANGELOG)
2. `tests/` — a lean test suite (`test_xlfg_v6.py`) that guards the plugin shape, the command frontmatter, and the load-bearing philosophy
3. `scripts/lint_plugin.py` — a frontmatter linter run in CI
4. `docs/` — historical research notes from the v3–v5 era (architecture, hooks, subagent hardening, planning autonomy). Kept as archival reading, not active guidance
5. `NEXT_AGENT_CONTEXT.md` — required handoff document for the next agent who touches this repo
6. `AGENTS.md` — short repo-level orientation

## Running the audit locally

```bash
python3 plugins/xlfg-engineering/scripts/audit_harness.py
```

Four checks: version sync, command surface, command frontmatter, forbidden-token sweep. Exit 0 on clean, 1 on any failure. `--json` for machine output.

## Running the test suite

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -v
```
